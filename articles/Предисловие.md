The ultimate goal of neural science is to understand how the flow of electrical signals through neural circuits gives rise to mind — to how we perceive, act, think, learn, and remember. Although we are still many decades away from achieving this level of understanding, neuroscientists have made significant progress in gaining insight into the neural mechanisms underlying behavior, the observable output of the nervous systems of humans and other organisms. We are also beginning to understand the disorders of behavior associated with neurological and psychiatric disease. As in the earlier editions of this book, we emphasize in this edition that behavior can be examined in terms of the electrical activity of both individual neurons and systems of nerve cells by seeking answers to five basic questions. How does the brain develop? How do nerve cells in the brain communicate with one another? How do different patterns of interconnections give rise to different perceptions and motor acts? How is the communication between neurons modified by experience? How is that communication altered by disease? When we published the first edition of this book in 1981, these questions could be addressed only in terms of cellular biology. By the fourth edition in 2000 the same problems were being studied at the molecular level. In the decade intervening between the fourth and the present edition, molecular biology has continued to enlighten the analysis of neurobiological problems. Molecular biology has made it possible to probe the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases, including several devastating genetic disorders: muscular dystrophy, retinoblastoma, neurofibromatosis, Huntington disease, and certain forms of Alzheimer disease. Molecular biology also has greatly expanded our understanding of how the brain develops. Genetically modified worms, flies, and mice have allowed us to relate single genes, including the mutant genes underlying neurological disease, to signaling in nerve cells and to an organism’s behavior. At the same time new molecular and optical tools have made it possible to image the activity of individual neurons in the intact brain and to manipulate the electrical activity of neurons and neural circuits to alter behavior. Such experiments have made it possible to examine the molecular dynamics of nerve cells in the circuits responsible for cognitive processes. Every disease that affects the nervous system has some inherited component. Now that the 20,000 genes of the human genome have been sequenced, it is possible to identify which genes make us susceptible to certain disorders and thus to predict an individual’s predisposition to a particular illness. This knowledge of the human genome is beginning to transform the practice of medicine. An individual genome scan can quantify the personal risk for neurological and psychiatric disorders at levels of increasing detail and complexity. We therefore again stress vigorously our view—advocated since the first edition—that the future of clinical neurology and psychiatry depends on the progress of neural science. Despite the power of molecular biology to elucidate molecular mechanisms of neural function and disease, any detailed understanding of how neurons act to generate complex behaviors requires an analysis of the circuitry in which the neurons participate. Thus, key questions in neuroscience include: How are neuronal assemblies formed during development? What are the computations performed by those neural circuits and how does this activity generate behavior? How are circuits modified during learning and memory? What are the changes in neural circuits that give rise to neurological and psychiatric disease? Although the cellular and molecular biological approaches emphasized in the previous editions will certainly continue to yield important information, knowledge of the function of assemblies of neurons in defined circuits must be attained to arrive at a comprehensive cognitive neuroscience.
