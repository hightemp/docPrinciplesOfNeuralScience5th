# Два противоположных мнения были выдвинуты на отношения между мозгом и поведением

Our views about nerve cells, the brain, and behavior  emerged during the 20th century from a synthesis of  five experimental traditions: anatomy, embryology,  physiology, pharmacology, and psychology.      

The 2nd century Greek physician Galen proposed  that nerves convey fluid secreted by the brain and spinal cord to the body’s periphery. His views dominated  Western medicine until the microscope revealed the  true structure of the cells in nervous tissue. Even so,  nervous tissue did not become the subject of a special  science until the late 1800s, when the Italian Camillo  Golgi and the Spaniard Santiago Ramón y Cajal produced detailed, accurate descriptions of nerve cells.      

Golgi developed a method of staining neurons  with silver salts that revealed their entire cell structure under the microscope. He could see clearly that  each neuron typically has a cell body and two types  of processes: branching dendrites at one end and a  long, cable-like axon at the other. Using Golgi’s technique, Ramón y Cajal discovered that nervous tissue  is not a syncytium, a continuous web of elements,  but a network of discrete cells. In the course of this  work Ramén y Cajal developed some of the key  concepts and much of the early evidence for the neuron  doctrine — the principle that individual neurons are the  elementary building blocks and signaling elements of  the nervous system.      

In the 1920s support for the neuron doctrine was  provided by the American embryologist Ross Harrison, who showed that dendrites and the axon grow  from the cell body and that they do so even when  each neuron is isolated from others in tissue culture.  Harrison also confirmed Ramón y Cajal's suggestion  that the tip of the axon gives rise to an expansion, the  growth cone, which leads the developing axon to its target, either to other nerve cells or muscles. The final and  definite proof of the neuron doctrine came in the mid 1950s with the introduction of electron microscopy.  A landmark study by Sanford Palay unambiguously  demonstrated the existence of synapses, specialized  regions that permit chemical or electrical signaling  between neurons.
