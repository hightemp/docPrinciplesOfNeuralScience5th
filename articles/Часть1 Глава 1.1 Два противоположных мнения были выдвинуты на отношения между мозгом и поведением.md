# Два противоположных мнения были выдвинуты на отношения между мозгом и поведением

Наши взгляды на нервные клетки, мозг и поведение возникли в 20 веке из синтеза пяти экспериментальных традиций: анатомии, эмбриологии, физиологии, фармакологии и психологии.      

Греческий врач 2-го века Гален предположил, что нервы доставляют жидкость, выделяемую мозгом и спинным мозгом, к периферии тела. Его взгляды доминировали в западной медицине, пока микроскоп не выявил истинную структуру клеток нервной ткани. Несмотря на это, нервная ткань не стала предметом специальной науки до конца 1800-х годов, когда итальянец Камилло Гольджи и испанец Сантьяго Рамон и Кахаль дали подробные, точные описания нервных клеток.      

Гольджи разработал метод окрашивания нейронов солями серебра, который выявил всю их клеточную структуру под микроскопом. Он мог ясно видеть, что каждый нейрон обычно имеет клеточное тело и два типа процессов: ветвящиеся дендриты на одном конце и длинный, похожий на кабель аксон на другом. Используя технику Гольджи, Рамон и Кахал обнаружили, что нервная ткань - это не синцитий, непрерывная сеть элементов, а сеть отдельных клеток. В ходе этой работы Рамени Кахал разработал некоторые из ключевых концепций и большую часть ранних доказательств доктрины нейронов - принципа, согласно которому отдельные нейроны являются элементарными строительными блоками и сигнальными элементами нервной системы.      

В 1920-х годах поддержку доктрины нейронов оказал американский эмбриолог Росс Харрисон, который показал, что дендриты и аксоны растут из тела клетки и что они делают это, даже когда каждый нейрон изолирован в культуре тканей. Харрисон также подтвердил предположение Рамона и Кахаля о том, что кончик аксона вызывает расширение, конус роста, который ведет развивающийся аксон к его цели, либо к другим нервным клеткам или мышцам. Окончательное и определенное доказательство доктрины нейронов появилось в середине 1950-х годов с введением электронной микроскопии. Важное исследование, проведенное Sanford Palay, однозначно продемонстрировало существование синапсов, специализированных областей, позволяющих передавать химические или электрические сигналы между нейронами. 

Физиологическое исследование нервной системы началось в конце 1700-х годов, когда итальянский врач и физик Луиджи Гальвани обнаружил, что мышечные и нервные клетки производят электричество. Современная электрофизиология выросла из работы в 19 веке тремя немецкими физиологами - Йоханнесом Мюллером, Эмилем дю Буа-Реймоном и Германом фон Гельмгольцем - которым удалось измерить скорость проведения электрической активности по аксону нерва. Клетка и далее показала, что электрическая активность одной нервной клетки влияет на активность соседней клетки предсказуемым образом.  

Фармакология впервые повлияла на наше состояние нервной системы и поведения в конце 19-го века, когда Клод Бернар во Франции, Поль Эрлих в Германии и Джон Лэнгли в Англии продемонстрировали, что лекарства не действуют нигде клетку, а точнее связывают дискретные рецепторы, обычно расположенные в поверхностной мембране клетки. Это понимание привело к открытию, что нервные клетки могут общаться друг с другом химическими средствами. 

Psychological thinking about behavior dates back to the beginnings of Western science when the ancient Greek philosophers speculated about the causes of behavior and the relation of the mind to the brain. In the 17th century René Descartes distinguished body and mind. In Descartes' dualistic view the brain mediates perception, motor acts, memory, appetites, and passions — everything that can be found in the lower animals. But the mind — the higher mental functions, the conscious experience characteristic of human behavior — is not represented in the brain or any other part of the body but in the soul, a spiritual entity that communicates with the machinery of the brain by means of the pineal gland, a tiny structure in the midline of the brain. Later in the 17th century Baruch Spinoza began to develop a Imified view of mind and body.

In the 18th century Western ideas about the mind  split along new lines. Empiricists believed that the  brain is initially a blank slate (tabula rasa) that is later  filled by sensory experience, whereas idealists, notably  Immanuel Kant, believed that our perception of the  world is determined by inherent features of our mind  or brain. In the mid-19th century Charles Darwin set  the stage for the modern understanding of the brain  as the seat of all behavior. He also advanced the even  more radical idea that animals could serve as models  of human behavior. Thus the study of evolution gave  rise to ethology, the investigation of the behavior of  animals in their natural setting, and later to experimental psychology, the study of human and animal  behavior under controlled conditions. At the beginning of the 20th century Sigmimd Freud introduced psychoanalysis. As the first systematic cognitive psychology, psychoanalysis framed the enormous problems  that confront us in understanding the human mind.      

Attempts to join biological and psychological concepts in the study of behavior began as early as 1800,  when Franz Joseph Call, a Viennese physician and  neuroanatomist, proposed two radically new ideas.  First, he advocated that the brain is the organ of the  mind and that all mental functions emanate from the  brain. In so doing, he rejected the idea that mind and  body are separate entities. Second, he argued that the  cerebral cortex did not function as a single organ but  contained within it many organs, and that particular  regions of the cerebral cortex control specific functions.  Gall enumerated at least 27 distinct regions or organs  of the cerebral cortex; later many more were added,  each corresponding to a specific mental faculty. Gall  assigned intellectual processes, such as the ability to  evaluate causality, to calculate, and to sense order, to  the front of the brain. Instinctive characteristics such  as romantic love (amativeness) and combativeness  were assigned to the back of the brain. Even the most  abstract of human behaviors — generosity, secretiveness, and religiosity — were assigned a spot in the brain  (Figure 1-1).

Although Gall's theory of localization was prescient, his experimental approach to localization was  extremely naive. Rather than localize functions empirically, by looking into the brain and correlating defects  in mental attributes with lesions in specific regions  following tumor or stroke, Gall spurned all evidence  derived from examination of brain lesions, discovered  clinically or produced surgically in experimental animals. Influenced by physiognomy, the popular science  based on the idea that facial features reveal character,  Gall believed that the bumps and ridges on the skulls of  people well endowed with specific faculties identified  the centers for those faculties in the brain. He assumed  that the size of an area of brain was related to the  mental faculty represented in that area. Accordingly,  exercise of a given mental faculty would cause the corresponding brain region to grow and this growth in  turn would cause the overlying skull to protrude.      

Gall first had this idea as a young boy when he  noticed that those of his classmates who excelled at  memorizing school assignments had prominent eyes.  He concluded that this was the result of an over development of regions in the front of the brain involved in  verbal memory. He developed this idea further when,  as a young physician, he was placed in charge of an  asylum for the insane in Vienna. There he began to study  patients suffering from monomania, a disorder characterized by an exaggerated interest in some key idea or a deep urge to engage in some specific behavior — theft, murder, eroticism, extreme religiosity. He reasoned that, because the patient functioned well in  all other behaviors, the brain defect must be discrete  and in principle could be localized by examining  the skulls of these patients. Based on these findings  Gall drew cortical maps such as those of Figure 1-1.  Gall's studies of localized brain functions led to  phrenology, a discipline concerned with determining  personality and character based on the detailed shape of  the skull.

> **Figure 1—1** An early map of functional localization in the  brain. 
According to the 19th century doctrine of phrenology,  complex traits such as combativeness, spirituality, hope, and  conscientiousness are controlled by specific areas in the brain,  which expand as the traits develop.
This enlargement of local  areas of the brain was thought to produce characteristic bumps  and ridges on the overlying skull, from which an individual's  character could be determined.
This map, taken from a drawing  of the early 1800s, purports to show 42 intellectual and emotional  faculties in distinct areas of the skull and the cerebral cortex  underneath.


In the late 1820s Gall’s ideas were subjected to  experimental analysis by the French physiologist Pierre  Flourens. By systematically destroying Gall’s functional centers in the brains of experimental animals,  Flourens attempted to isolate the contribution of each  ”cerebral organ” to behavior. From these experiments  Flourens concluded that specific brain regions are not responsible for specific behaviors, but that all brain  regions, especially the cerebral hemispheres of the fore-brain, participate in every mental operation. Any part  of a cerebral hemisphere, Flourens proposed, is able to  perform all the hemisphere's functions. Injury to any  one area of the cerebral hemisphere should therefore  affect all higher functions equally. Thus in 1823 Flourens wrote: ”All perceptions, all volitions occupy the  same seat in these (cerebral) organs; the faculty of perceiving, of conceiving, of willing merely constitutes  therefore a faculty which is essentially one.”      

The rapid acceptance of this belief, later called  the holistic view of the brain, was based only partly  on Flourens's experimental work. It also represented  a cultural reaction against the materialistic view that  the human mind is a biological organ. It represented a rejection of the notion that there is no soul, that all  mental processes can be reduced to activity within the  brain, and that the mind can be improved by exercising it, ideas that were unacceptable to the religious  establishment and landed aristocracy of Europe.      

The holistic view was seriously challenged, however, in the mid-19th century by the French neurologist Paul Pierre Broca, the German neurologist Carl  Wernicke, and the British neurologist Hughlings  Jackson. For example, in his studies of focal epilepsy,  a disease characterized by convulsions that begin in a  particular part of the body, Jackson showed that different mo tor and sensory functions could be traced to  specific parts of the cerebral cortex. The regional studies of Broca, Wernicke, and Jackson were extended  to the cellular level by Charles Sherrington and by Ramén y Cajal, who championed the view of brain  function called cellular connectionism. According to  this view individual neurons are the signaling units  of the brain; they are arranged in functional groups  and connect to one another in a precise fashion.  Wernicke’s work and that of the French neurologist  Jules Dejerine in particular revealed that different  behaviors are produced by different interconnected  brain regions.      

The first important evidence for localization  emerged from studies of how the brain produces language. Before we consider the relevant clinical and  anatomical studies, we shall first review the overall  structure of the brain. (The anatomical organization  of the nervous system is described in some detail in  Chapter 17.)


**Box 1—1 The Central Nervous System**

**The Central Nervous System Has Seven Main Parts.**

The spinal cord, the most caudal part of the central  nervous system, receives and processes sensory information from the skin, joints, and muscles of the limbs  and tumk and controls movement of the limbs and the  trunk. It is subdivided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar,  and sacral regions (Figure 1—2A).      

The spinal cord continues rostrally as the brain  stem, which consists of the medulla oblongata, pons,  and midbrain. The brain stem receives sensory information from the skin and muscles of the head and provides  the motor control for the head’s musculature. It also conveys information from the spinal cord to the brain and  from the brain to the spinal cord, and regulates levels of  arousal and awareness through the reticular formation.      

The brain stem contains several collections of cell  bodies, the cranial nerve nuclei. Some of these nuclei  receive information from the skin and muscles of the  head; others control motor output to muscles of the  face, neck, and eyes. Still others are specialized to process information from three of the special senses: hearing, balance, and taste.      

The medulla oblongata, directly rostral to the spinal cord, includes several centers responsible for vital  autonomic functions, such as digestion, breathing, and  the control of heart rate.      

The pons, rostral to the medulla, conveys information about movement from the cerebral hemispheres to  the cerebelltun.

The cerebellum lies behind the pons and is connected to the brain stem by several major fiber tracts  called pedmicles. The cerebellum modulates the force  and range of movement and is involved in the learning  of motor skills.      

The midbrain, rostral to the pons, controls many  sensory and motor functions, including eye movement  and the coordination of visual and auditory reflexes.     

The diencephalon lies rostral to the midbrain and  contains two structures. The thalamus processes most  of the information reaching the cerebral cortex from  the rest of the central nervous system. The hypothalamus regulates autonomic, endocrine, and visceral  functions.      

The cerebrum comprises two cerebral hemispheres,  each consisting of a heavily wrinkled outer layer (the  cerebral cortex) and three deep-lying structures (the basal  ganglia, the hippocampus, and the amygdaloid nuclei). The  cerebral cortex is divided into four distinct lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal (Figure 1—23).      
The basal ganglia participate in regulating motor  performance; the hippocampus is involved with aspects  of memory storage; and the amygdaloid nuclei coordinate the autonomic and endocrine responses of emotional states.      

The brain is also commonly divided into three broader regions: the hindbrain (medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebellum), midbrain, and forebrain (diencephalon and cerebrum).  The hindbrain (excluding the cerebellum) and midbrain  together include the same structures as the brain stem.
