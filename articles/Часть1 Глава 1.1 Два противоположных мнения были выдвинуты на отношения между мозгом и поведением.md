# Два противоположных мнения были выдвинуты на отношения между мозгом и поведением

Our views about nerve cells, the brain, and behavior  emerged during the 20th century from a synthesis of  five experimental traditions: anatomy, embryology,  physiology, pharmacology, and psychology.      

The 2nd century Greek physician Galen proposed  that nerves convey fluid secreted by the brain and spinal cord to the body’s periphery. His views dominated  Western medicine until the microscope revealed the  true structure of the cells in nervous tissue. Even so,  nervous tissue did not become the subject of a special  science until the late 1800s, when the Italian Camillo  Golgi and the Spaniard Santiago Ramón y Cajal produced detailed, accurate descriptions of nerve cells.      

Golgi developed a method of staining neurons  with silver salts that revealed their entire cell structure under the microscope. He could see clearly that  each neuron typically has a cell body and two types  of processes: branching dendrites at one end and a  long, cable-like axon at the other. Using Golgi’s technique, Ramón y Cajal discovered that nervous tissue  is not a syncytium, a continuous web of elements,  but a network of discrete cells. In the course of this  work Ramén y Cajal developed some of the key  concepts and much of the early evidence for the neuron  doctrine — the principle that individual neurons are the  elementary building blocks and signaling elements of  the nervous system.      

In the 1920s support for the neuron doctrine was  provided by the American embryologist Ross Harrison, who showed that dendrites and the axon grow  from the cell body and that they do so even when  each neuron is isolated from others in tissue culture.  Harrison also confirmed Ramón y Cajal's suggestion  that the tip of the axon gives rise to an expansion, the  growth cone, which leads the developing axon to its target, either to other nerve cells or muscles. The final and  definite proof of the neuron doctrine came in the mid 1950s with the introduction of electron microscopy.  A landmark study by Sanford Palay unambiguously  demonstrated the existence of synapses, specialized  regions that permit chemical or electrical signaling  between neurons. 

Physiological investigation of the nervous system began in the late 1700s when the Italian physician and physicist Luigi Galvani discovered that muscle and nerve cells produce electricity. Modern electrophysiology grew out of work in the 19th century by three German physiologists — Johannes Muller, Emil du Bois-Reymond, and Hermann von Helmholtz — who succeeded in measuring the speed of conduction of electrical activity along the axon of the nerve cell and further showed that the electrical activity of one nerve cell affects the activity of an adjacent cell in predict- able ways.  

Pharmacology made its first impact on our Imder — standing of the nervous system and behavior at the end of the 19th century when Claude Bernard in France, Paul Ehrlich in Germany, and John Langley in England demonstrated that drugs do not act just anywhere on a cell, but rather bind discrete receptors typically located in the surface membrane of the cell. This insight led to the discovery that nerve cells can communicate with each other by chemical means.  

Psychological thinking about behavior dates back to the beginnings of Western science when the ancient Greek philosophers speculated about the causes of behavior and the relation of the mind to the brain. In the 17th century René Descartes distinguished body and mind. In Descartes' dualistic view the brain mediates perception, motor acts, memory, appetites, and passions — everything that can be found in the lower animals. But the mind — the higher mental functions, the conscious experience characteristic of human behavior — is not represented in the brain or any other part of the body but in the soul, a spiritual entity that communicates with the machinery of the brain by means of the pineal gland, a tiny structure in the midline of the brain. Later in the 17th century Baruch Spinoza began to develop a Imified view of mind and body.

In the 18th century Western ideas about the mind  split along new lines. Empiricists believed that the  brain is initially a blank slate (tabula rasa) that is later  filled by sensory experience, whereas idealists, notably  Immanuel Kant, believed that our perception of the  world is determined by inherent features of our mind  or brain. In the mid-19th century Charles Darwin set  the stage for the modern understanding of the brain  as the seat of all behavior. He also advanced the even  more radical idea that animals could serve as models  of human behavior. Thus the study of evolution gave  rise to ethology, the investigation of the behavior of  animals in their natural setting, and later to experimental psychology, the study of human and animal  behavior under controlled conditions. At the beginning of the 20th century Sigmimd Freud introduced psychoanalysis. As the first systematic cognitive psychology, psychoanalysis framed the enormous problems  that confront us in understanding the human mind.      

Attempts to join biological and psychological concepts in the study of behavior began as early as 1800,  when Franz Joseph Call, a Viennese physician and  neuroanatomist, proposed two radically new ideas.  First, he advocated that the brain is the organ of the  mind and that all mental functions emanate from the  brain. In so doing, he rejected the idea that mind and  body are separate entities. Second, he argued that the  cerebral cortex did not function as a single organ but  contained within it many organs, and that particular  regions of the cerebral cortex control specific functions.  Gall enumerated at least 27 distinct regions or organs  of the cerebral cortex; later many more were added,  each corresponding to a specific mental faculty. Gall  assigned intellectual processes, such as the ability to  evaluate causality, to calculate, and to sense order, to  the front of the brain. Instinctive characteristics such  as romantic love (amativeness) and combativeness  were assigned to the back of the brain. Even the most  abstract of human behaviors — generosity, secretiveness, and religiosity — were assigned a spot in the brain  (Figure 1-1).

Although Gall's theory of localization was prescient, his experimental approach to localization was  extremely naive. Rather than localize functions empirically, by looking into the brain and correlating defects  in mental attributes with lesions in specific regions  following tumor or stroke, Gall spurned all evidence  derived from examination of brain lesions, discovered  clinically or produced surgically in experimental animals. Influenced by physiognomy, the popular science  based on the idea that facial features reveal character,  Gall believed that the bumps and ridges on the skulls of  people well endowed with specific faculties identified  the centers for those faculties in the brain. He assumed  that the size of an area of brain was related to the  mental faculty represented in that area. Accordingly,  exercise of a given mental faculty would cause the corresponding brain region to grow and this growth in  turn would cause the overlying skull to protrude.      

Gall first had this idea as a young boy when he  noticed that those of his classmates who excelled at  memorizing school assignments had prominent eyes.  He concluded that this was the result of an over development of regions in the front of the brain involved in  verbal memory. He developed this idea further when,  as a young physician, he was placed in charge of an  asylum for the insane in Vienna. There he began to study  patients suffering from monomania, a disorder characterized by an exaggerated interest in some key idea or a deep urge to engage in some specific behavior — theft, murder, eroticism, extreme religiosity. He reasoned that, because the patient functioned well in  all other behaviors, the brain defect must be discrete  and in principle could be localized by examining  the skulls of these patients. Based on these findings  Gall drew cortical maps such as those of Figure 1-1.  Gall's studies of localized brain functions led to  phrenology, a discipline concerned with determining  personality and character based on the detailed shape of  the skull.

Figure 1—1 An early map of functional localization in the  brain. According to the 19th century doctrine of phrenology,  complex traits such as combativeness, spirituality, hope, and  conscientiousness are controlled by specific areas in the brain,  which expand as the traits develop.This enlargement of local  areas of the brain was thought to produce characteristic bumps  and ridges on the overlying skull, from which an individual's  character could be determined.This map, taken from a drawing  of the early 1800s, purports to show 42 intellectual and emotional  faculties in distinct areas of the skull and the cerebral cortex  underneath.

In the late 1820s Gall’s ideas were subjected to  experimental analysis by the French physiologist Pierre  Flourens. By systematically destroying Gall’s functional centers in the brains of experimental animals,  Flourens attempted to isolate the contribution of each  ”cerebral organ” to behavior. From these experiments  Flourens concluded that specific brain regions are not responsible for specific behaviors, but that all brain  regions, especially the cerebral hemispheres of the fore-brain, participate in every mental operation. Any part  of a cerebral hemisphere, Flourens proposed, is able to  perform all the hemisphere's functions. Injury to any  one area of the cerebral hemisphere should therefore  affect all higher functions equally. Thus in 1823 Flourens wrote: ”All perceptions, all volitions occupy the  same seat in these (cerebral) organs; the faculty of perceiving, of conceiving, of willing merely constitutes  therefore a faculty which is essentially one.”      

The rapid acceptance of this belief, later called  the holistic view of the brain, was based only partly  on Flourens's experimental work. It also represented  a cultural reaction against the materialistic view that  the human mind is a biological organ. It represented a rejection of the notion that there is no soul, that all  mental processes can be reduced to activity within the  brain, and that the mind can be improved by exercising it, ideas that were unacceptable to the religious  establishment and landed aristocracy of Europe.      

The holistic view was seriously challenged, however, in the mid-19th century by the French neurologist Paul Pierre Broca, the German neurologist Carl  Wernicke, and the British neurologist Hughlings  Jackson. For example, in his studies of focal epilepsy,  a disease characterized by convulsions that begin in a  particular part of the body, Jackson showed that different mo tor and sensory functions could be traced to  specific parts of the cerebral cortex. The regional studies of Broca, Wernicke, and Jackson were extended  to the cellular level by Charles Sherrington and by Ramén y Cajal, who championed the view of brain  function called cellular connectionism. According to  this view individual neurons are the signaling units  of the brain; they are arranged in functional groups  and connect to one another in a precise fashion.  Wernicke’s work and that of the French neurologist  Jules Dejerine in particular revealed that different  behaviors are produced by different interconnected  brain regions.      

The first important evidence for localization  emerged from studies of how the brain produces language. Before we consider the relevant clinical and  anatomical studies, we shall first review the overall  structure of the brain. (The anatomical organization  of the nervous system is described in some detail in  Chapter 17.)
