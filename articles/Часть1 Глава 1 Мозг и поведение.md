# Мозг и поведение

THE LAST FRONTIER OF THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES — the ultimate challenge — is to understand thebiological basis of consciousness and the brainprocesses by which we feel, act, learn, and remember.During the past few decades, a remarkable unification within the biological sciences has set the stage foraddressing this great challenge. The ability to sequencegenes and infer the amino acid sequences of the proteins they encode has revealed unanticipated similarities between proteins in the nervous system andthose encountered elsewhere in the body. As a result,it has become possible to establish a general plan forthe function of cells, a plan that provides a commonconceptual framework for all of cell biology, including cellular neural science. The current challenge inthe unification within biology, which we outline in thisbook, is the unification of the study of behavior — thescience of the mind — and neural science — the scienceof the brain.Such a unified approach, in which mind andbody are not viewed as separate entities, rests on theview that all behavior is the result of brain function.
