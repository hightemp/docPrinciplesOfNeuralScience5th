THE LAST FRONTIER OF THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES — the ultimate challenge — is to understand thebiological basis of consciousness and the brainprocesses by which we feel, act, learn, and remember.During the past few decades, a remarkable unification within the biological sciences has set the stage foraddressing this great challenge. The ability to sequencegenes and infer the amino acid sequences of the proteins they encode has revealed unanticipated similarities between proteins in the nervous system andthose encountered elsewhere in the body. As a result,it has become possible to establish a general plan forthe function of cells, a plan that provides a commonconceptual framework for all of cell biology, including cellular neural science. The current challenge inthe unification within biology, which we outline in thisbook, is the unification of the study of behavior — thescience of the mind — and neural science — the scienceof the brain.

Such a unified approach, in which mind andbody are not viewed as separate entities, rests on theview that all behavior is the result of brain function. What we commonly call the mind is a set of operationscarried out by the brain. Brain processes Lmderlie notonly simple motor behaviors such as walking and eating but also all the complex cognitive ac ts and behaviorthat we regard as quintessentially human—thinking,speaking, and creating works of art. As a corollary, allthe behavioral disorders that characterize psychiatricillness—disorders of affect (feeling) and cognition(thought)—result from disturbances of brain function.  

How do the billions of individual nerve cells in thebrain produce behalvior and cognitive states, and howare those cells inf‌luenced by the environment, whichincludes social experience? Explaining behavior interms of the brain's activities is the task of neural science, and the progress of neural science in explaininghuman behavior is a major theme of this book.  Neural science must continually confront certainfundamental questions. Is a particular mental processcarried out in specific regions of the brain, or does itinvolve the brain as a whole? If a mental process canbe localized to discrete brain regions, what is the relationship between the functions of those regions in perception, movement, or thought and the anatomy andphysiology of those regions? Are these relationshipsmore likely to be understood by examining each regionas a whole or by studying individual nerve cells?  

To answer these questions we shall examine howmodern neural science describes language, one of themost htunan of cognitive behaviors. In so doing weshall focus on the cerebral cortex, the part of the brainthat is most highly developed in humans. We shall seehow the cortex is organized into functionally distinctregions, each made up of large groups of neurons,and how the neural apparatus of a highly complex
