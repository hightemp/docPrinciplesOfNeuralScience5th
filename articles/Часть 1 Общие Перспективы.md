# Часть 1 Общие Перспективы

During the second half of the 20th century, the central
focus of biology was on the gene. Now in the 3rst half of
the 21st century, the central focus of biology has shifted to
neural science and speci3cally to the biology of the mind. We need
to understand the processes by which we perceive, act, learn, and
remember. How does the brain — an organ weighing only three
pounds—conceive of the in3nite, discover new knowledge, and produce
the remarkable individuality of human thoughts, feelings, and
actions? How are these extraordinary mental capabilities distributed
within the organ? How are different mental processes localized to
speci3c combinations of regions in the brain? What rules relate the
anatomical organization and the cellular physiology of a region to
its speci3c role in mentation? To what extent are mental processes
hardwired into the neural architecture of the brain? What do genes
contribute to behavior, and how is gene expression in nerve cells
regulated by developmental and learning processes? How does
experience alter the way the brain processes subsequent events, and
to what degree is that processing unconscious? Finally, what is the
neural basis underlying neurological and psychiatric disease? In this
introductory section of Principles of Neural Science, we attempt to
address these questions. In so doing, we describe how neural science
is attempting to link the logic of neural circuitry to the mind—how
the activities of nerve cells within de3ned, neural circuits are related
to the complexity of mental processes.
